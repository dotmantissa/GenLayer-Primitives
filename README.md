# Agent Task Escrow

A decentralized, autonomous task escrow and deliverable adjudication primitive built on GenLayer.

The Agent Task Escrow primitive enables trustless delegation in the agentic economy. A client deposits escrow funds when commissioning knowledge work from an agent (human, AI, or autonomous system). The task specification is defined in natural language alongside explicit, weighted acceptance criteria. When the agent completes the task and submits deliverable URLs, GenLayer validator committees independently fetch the deliverables, evaluate them against each individual criterion in the rubric, and score each requirement on substantive performance rather than superficial formatting.

The contract calculates proportional partial payouts for partially completed deliverables and executes automated settlement directly on-chain, eliminating the need for centralized platform arbitrators or subjective manual disputes.

## The Problem

Delegating knowledge work inside the decentralized agentic economy faces a fundamental coordination barrier:

1. Subjectivity of Completion: Unlike quantitative microtasks, knowledge deliverables (codebases, research reports, security audits, dataset synthesis) cannot be validated by simple cryptographic hashes or regex patterns.
2. The Wrapper Trap: A single LLM call acting as an oracle is unreliable and fragile. Prompt gaming, non-deterministic phrasing, and hallucinated scores make raw LLM decisions dangerous for financial settlement.
3. All-or-Nothing Escrow: Traditional smart contracts force binary outcomes (100% payout or 100% refund). Real-world deliverables are often 70% or 85% complete, leading to disputes where either the agent or the client is unfairly penalized.
4. Scope Creep and Superficial Compliance: Agents may submit boilerplate templates or bloated deliverables that match file structure without fulfilling the substantive technical requirements of the brief.

## The GenLayer Solution

The Agent Task Escrow primitive uses GenLayer's Optimistic Democracy consensus to provide autonomous, objective settlement over subjective work:

- Natural Language Task Specification: Clients write briefs and define explicit rubrics with assigned basis-point weights summing to 10000 (100.00%).
- Multi-Node Web Retrieval: Validators independently fetch external deliverables (GitHub pull requests, documentation endpoints, hosted reports) without relying on a centralized oracle.
- Fine-Grained Rubric Scoring: Validators evaluate each acceptance criterion individually, grading each from 0 to 100 points based on substance rather than format.
- Proportional Partial Settlement: If a deliverable fulfills some but not all criteria, the contract automatically calculates the mathematical payout proportion, paying the agent for verified work and refunding the client for incomplete scope.
- Strict Equivalence Principles: Consensus requires validator nodes to agree both on the categorical pass/fail verdict and on the partial credit score within an explicit tolerance band (1000 basis points / 10.00%).

## Rubric Design and Payout Model

### Acceptance Criteria Format
When creating a task, the client supplies a JSON array of structured criteria objects:

```json
[
  {
    "id": "c1_correctness",
    "description": "Functional implementation matches all requested endpoints and schemas",
    "weight_bps": 5000
  },
  {
    "id": "c2_quality",
    "description": "Code passes test suite and includes clean error handling and documentation",
    "weight_bps": 3000
  },
  {
    "id": "c3_architecture",
    "description": "Clean modular architecture without scope creep or extraneous dependencies",
    "weight_bps": 2000
  }
]
```

Criteria requirements enforced on-chain:
- Array length between 1 and 10 criteria.
- Unique criterion IDs.
- Descriptions at least 5 characters long.
- Individual weights must be positive integers.
- Total weights across all criteria must sum exactly to 10000 basis points (100.00%).

### Scoring Formula
The validator committee evaluates each criterion $i$ with a score $S_i \in [0, 100]$:

$$\text{weighted\_score\_bps} = \sum_{i} \frac{S_i \times W_i}{100}$$

Where $W_i$ is the basis-point weight of criterion $i$.

### Financial Settlement Rules
Let $E$ be the locked escrow in wei, $T_{\text{min}}$ be `min_threshold_bps`, and $T_{\text{full}}$ be `full_threshold_bps`:

1. Complete Failure ($\text{weighted\_score} < T_{\text{min}}$):
   - Agent Payout = 0
   - Client Refund = $E$ (100% refund)
   - Evaluation Tier = `CLEAR_FAIL`

2. Full Completion ($\text{weighted\_score} \ge T_{\text{full}}$):
   - Agent Payout = $E$ (100% payout)
   - Client Refund = 0
   - Evaluation Tier = `CLEAR_PASS`

3. Proportional Partial Credit ($T_{\text{min}} \le \text{weighted\_score} < T_{\text{full}}$):
   - Agent Payout = $\lfloor \frac{E \times \text{weighted\_score}}{10000} \rfloor$
   - Client Refund = $E - \text{Agent Payout}$
   - Evaluation Tier = `PARTIAL_COMPLIANCE`

## Consensus and Equivalence Principle

Consensus execution runs via `gl.vm.run_nondet_unsafe`:

1. Leader Execution:
   - Fetches deliverable URLs and task specification URL.
   - Formulates a structured adjudication prompt detailing the brief, criteria, and submission notes.
   - Queries LLM with JSON schema enforcement.
   - Computes weighted score deterministically from criterion scores.
   - Derives compliance types (`FULL`, `PARTIAL_SUBSTANCE`, `FORMAT_ONLY`, `NON_COMPLIANT`).

2. Validator Verification:
   - Validates that leader result is a valid return dictionary.
   - Independently fetches the same deliverable and specification URLs.
   - Runs independent LLM prompt and computes independent score.
   - Equivalence checks:
     * Binary Agreement: `leader_passed == validator_passed`. Disagreement causes immediate rejection.
     * Score Tolerance: `abs(leader_score - validator_score) <= 1000` (10.00% tolerance band).
     * Tier Coherence: Contradictory polar tiers (`CLEAR_PASS` vs `CLEAR_FAIL`) cause immediate rejection.
